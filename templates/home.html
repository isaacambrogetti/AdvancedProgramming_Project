    <h2>Metagenome analysis</h2>
    <p>
      This software allows you to read GFF3 files, retrieve the information related to genetic material and allow operations to be executed on datas under the form of a Pandas DataFrame.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case a given GFF3 file about the human genome annotation is the source of genomics information for enabling the operations to be executed.<br>
      By using a dataset object, various insights can be gained from the data through the execution of operations. Each operation is carried out on a dataset object, producing another dataset object as a result. There are several types of operations that can be executed, all of which can be accessed and executed by a dataset object regardless of the specific operation type.<br>
